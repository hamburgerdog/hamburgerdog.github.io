Welcome to Josiah Hong's blog space! I'm based in Shenzhen, China, working as a web frontend developer at SmartMore. I have a passion for programming, the outdoors, and riding. This blog is a platform where I share insights into both life and technology.

My technology stack includes `TypeScript/JavaScript` and `React.js`, with a focus on the `Canvas` domain. I have a strong command of `opencv.js + wasm` and other front-end technologies. Currently, I am actively engaged in projects involving `pixi.js`.
